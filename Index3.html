 Various areas of A
<h1>Various areas of AI&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>AI is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings. &nbsp;</h2>
<p>The major areas of AI are:</p>
<p>Pattern Recognition – Recognising patters in given data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robotics – Allowing mechanical devices to navigate and manipulate their environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Natural Language Processing – Communicating with humans through natural text and speech.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artificial Life - Modelling and mimicking living systems. &nbsp;<span> </span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer" data-show-preview="true"> </a>  &nbsp;<span id="ref231052"> </span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/robot-technology" data-show-preview="true"> </a>        &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several approaches to AI, including: Machine learning: This approach involves building algorithms that can learn patterns in data and make predictions based on that data. Natural language processing (NLP): This approach deals with the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. It involves tasks such as text and speech recognition, translation, and sentiment analysis. Robotics: This approach involves the use of AI to design, build, and control robots. It involves tasks such as perception, decision-making, and movement. Computer vision: This approach deals with the processing and analysis of visual information from the real world. It involves tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and scene understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI can be broadly classified into two: Narrow AI: This type of AI is also referred to as “weak AI”. Narrow AI usually carries out one particular task with extremely high efficiency which mimics human intelligence. An example would be any computer game where one player is the user and the other player is the computer. What usually happens is, the machine is fed with all the rules and regulations of the game and the possible outcomes of the game manually. In turn, this machine applies these data to beat whoever is playing against it. A single particular task is carried out to mimic human intelligence. Strong AI: Also referred to as “general AI”. Here is where there is no difference between a machine and a human being. This is the kind of AI we see in the movies, the robots. A close example (not the perfect example) would be the world’s first citizen robot, Sophia. She was introduced to the world on October 11, 2017. Sophia talks like she has emotions.&nbsp;</p>
